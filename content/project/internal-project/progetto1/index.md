At the beginning of the first year of my Master's Degree in Electronics Engineering studies in Florence, me and friend of mine, Herve Corti, came up with the idea of working toghether to build audio electronics equipments. 
We decide to share our expericence in DIY audio electronic project developed during years spent at the university. He call in two other friends and after nearly two year of developments our first eurorack module was born.

SUMMINGFACILITY is a 6 channel audio mixer in modular eurorack form factor. The whole circuit is 100% analog. It features 6 
balanced audio channels with gain, level, pan --- control and mute. The output section of the mixer features two aux sends and two return channels.
