I've always been passionated about music and guitar (I play it since I was 10 years old). I stareted building pedals and amps from the moment I manage to use a soldering iron and I developed a passion for the old tube amp device. I these Years I build several guitar tube amplifier which I used regularly when I play whith my band.

Every one of the these amplifiers ss build using the old 50s turret board methods: no PCB, every components is soldered with point to point connection. Just hours of careful wiring and patience.
