I'v always been passionated about music and guitar (I play it since I was 10 years old). I stardted building pedals from the moment I manage to use a soldering iron, and I developed a passion for the old tube amp device. I these Years I build 5 to 6 all working guitar tube amplifier witch I used regularly when I play whith my band.

Every one of the these amplifiers Is build using the old 50s turret board methods: no PCB, every components is soldered with point to point connectio. Just hours of wiring and patience.
