I've always been passionated about music and guitar (I play it since I was 10 years old). I started building guitar pedals and amps from the moment I manage to use a soldering iron and I developed a passion for old tube amp device. In these years I build several guitar tube amplifiers which I use on regular basis when I play live with my band.

Every one of the these amplifiers is build using the old 50s turret board methods: no PCB, every components is soldered with point to point connection. Just hours of careful wiring and patience.
